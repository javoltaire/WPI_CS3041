            <description>List directory contents</description>
            <details>For each operand that names a file	of a type other	than directory,	ls
                displays its name as well as any requested, associated information. For
                each operand that names a file of type directory, ls displays the names
                of files contained within that directory, as well as any requested,
                associated information.

                If	no operands are	given, the contents of the current directory are displayed.
                If more than one operand is given, non-directory operands are displayed first;
                directory and non-directory operands are sorted separately and in lexicographical order.</details>
            <options>
                <A>Include directory entries whose names begin with a	dot (`.')
                    except for . and ... Automatically set for the super-user unless
                    -I	is specified.</A>
                <B>Force printing of non-printable characters (as defined by
                    ctype(3) and current locale settings) in file names as \xxx,
                    where xxx is the numeric value of the character in	octal.</B>
                <C>Force multi-column output; this is the default when output is to
                    a terminal.</C>
                <D>When printing in the long (-l) format, use format to format the
                    date and time output. The argument format is a string used by
                    strftime(3). Depending on the choice of format string, this may
                    result in a different number of columns in the output. This
                    option overrides the -T option.</D>
