            <description>List directory contents.</description>
            <details>For each operand that names a file	of a type other	than directory,	ls displays its name as well as any requested, associated information. For each operand that names a file of type directory, ls displays the names of files contained within that directory, as well as any requested, associated information.
                If	no operands are	given, the contents of the current directory are displayed. If more than one operand is given, non-directory operands are displayed first; directory and non-directory operands are sorted separately and in lexicographical order.</details>
            <options>
                <A>Include directory entries whose names begin with a dot (`.') except for . and ... Automatically set for the super-user unless -I is specified.</A>
                <B>Force printing of non-printable characters (as defined by ctype(3) and current locale settings) in file names as \xxx, where xxx is the numeric value of the character in octal.</B>
                <C>Force multi-column output; this is the default when output is to a terminal.</C>
                <D>When printing in the long (-l) format, use format to format the date and time output. The argument format is a string used by strftime(3). Depending on the choice of format string, this may result in a different number of columns in the output. This option overrides the -T option.</D>
