        <ls recentlyused="true">
            <description>List directory contents.</description>
            <details>For each operand that names a file	of a type other	than directory,	ls displays its name as well as any requested, associated information. For each operand that names a file of type directory, ls displays the names of files contained within that directory, as well as any requested, associated information.
                If	no operands are	given, the contents of the current directory are displayed. If more than one operand is given, non-directory operands are displayed first; directory and non-directory operands are sorted separately and in lexicographical order.</details>
            <options>
                <A>Include directory entries whose names begin with a dot (`.') except for . and ... Automatically set for the super-user unless -I is specified.</A>
                <B>Force printing of non-printable characters (as defined by ctype(3) and current locale settings) in file names as \xxx, where xxx is the numeric value of the character in octal.</B>
                <C>Force multi-column output; this is the default when output is to a terminal.</C>
                <D>When printing in the long (-l) format, use format to format the date and time output. The argument format is a string used by strftime(3). Depending on the choice of format string, this may result in a different number of columns in the output. This option overrides the -T option.</D>
                <l>(The lowercase letter ``ell''.) List files in the long format, as described in the The Long Format subsection below.</l>
            </options>
            <format>ls	[-option] [-D format] [file ...]</format>
            <example>

                <exDescription>List the contents of the current working directory in long format.</exDescription>

        <cp>
            <description>Copy files</description>
            <details>In	the first synopsis form, the cp	utility	copies the contents of the source_file to the target_file. In the second synopsis form, the contents of each named source_file is copied to the destination target_directory. The names of the files themselves are not changed. If cp detects an attempt to copy a file to itself, the copy will fail.</details>
            <options>
                <H>If the -R option is specified, symbolic links on the	command	line are followed. (Symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal are not followed.).</H>
                <L>If the -R option is specified, all symbolic links are followed.</L>
                <P>If the -R option is specified, no symbolic links are	followed. This is the default.</P>
                <R>If source_file designates a directory, cp copies the	directory and the entire subtree connected at that point. If the source_file ends in a /, the contents of the directory are copied rather than the directory itself. This option also causes symbolic links to be copied, rather than indirected through, and for cp to create special files rather than copying them as normal files. Created directories have the same mode as the corresponding source directory, unmodified by the process' umask.
                    Note that cp copies hard linked files as separate files. If you need to preserve hard links, consider using tar(1), cpio(1), or pax(1) instead.</R>
                <a>Archive mode. Same as -RpP</a>
