    <p class="quarter">Other historically fortuitous developments contributed to the establishment of HCI. Software engineering, mired in unmanageable software 
        complexity in the 1970s, was starting to focus on nonfunctional requirements, including usability and maintainability, and on empirical software
         development processes that relied on iterative prototyping and empirical testing. Computer graphics and information retrieval had emerged in the 
         1970s, and rapidly came to recognize that interactive systems were the key to progressing beyond early achievements. All these threads of development
          in computer science pointed to the same conclusion: The way forward for computing entailed understanding and better empowering users. These forces of 
          need and opportunity converged around 1980, focusing a burst of human energy
