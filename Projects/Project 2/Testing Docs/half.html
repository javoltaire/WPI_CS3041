    <p class="half">HCI (human-computer interaction) is the study of how people interact with computers and to what extent computers are or are not developed
     for successful interaction with human beings. A significant number of major corporations and academic institutions now study HCI. Historically and with 
     some exceptions, computer system developers have not paid much attention to computer ease-of-use. Many computer users today would argue that computer 
     makers are still not paying enough attention to making their products "user-friendly." However, computer system developers might argue that computers 
     are extremely complex products to design and make and that the demand for the services that computers can provide has always out driven the demand for 
     ease-of-use.
